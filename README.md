This is the developer guide for the awork API, which allows developers to access entities and business logic of awork. We’re glad you’re here, and we hope that the documentation will help you build something awesome.

At HQLabs we do our best to build a powerful and easy-to-use public API. What does that mean to you? It means that if you see something happening in the awork web app, you can probably do that same thing via the API.

Before you get started you’ll need to follow the following steps:

* Create an account in [awork.](https://awork.io/)
* Check out the article about [Authentication](authentication.md) .
* Check out how the [API](https://developers.awork.io/api-description/) works.

If you have any questions to our api, just create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/awork-io/awork/issues)
