# awork.com Developer Docs

This is the developer guide for the awork API, which allows developers to access awork's entities and business logic. We're glad you're here, and we hope that this documentation will help you build something awesome.

At awork, we do our best to build a powerful and easy-to-use public API. What does that mean for you? It means that if you see something happening in the awork web app, you can probably do that same thing via the API.
