# awork.io Developer Docs

![](.gitbook/assets/new-bg.png)

This is the developer guide for the awork API, which allows developers to access awork's entities and business logic. We're glad you're here, and we hope that this documentation will help you build something awesome.

At awork, we do our best to build a powerful and easy-to-use public API. What does that mean for you? It means that if you see something happening in the awork web app, you can probably do that same thing via the API.

Before you get started, youâ€™ll need to follow the following steps:

* Create an account in [awork.](https://awork.io/)
* Check out the article about [Authentication](authentication.md).
* Check out how the [API](https://openapi.awork.io/) works or import it to Postman or other clients: [https://swagger-doc.awork.io/api/swagger-combine](https://swagger-doc.awork.io/api/swagger-combine)
* [Subscribe](https://form.123formbuilder.com/form-6455567/api-newsletter-signup) to Updates and other Developer News.

If you have any questions to our api, simply create an _issue_ on [Github](https://github.com/awork-io/awork/issues)
