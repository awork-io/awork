## Getting help with the API

These Developer Docs should contain all details you need to successfully build apps and integrations with the awork API. We're happy to answer your questions in our [awork Community Developer Forum.](https://community.awork.com/c/developer-forum/17)

Please create a separate issue for each question. If you have issues with a particular request, please include as much detail as possible. Most importantly, we need the `Trace-Id` to be able to help you quickly.

## Finding the Trace-Id

The `Trace-Id` is an awork-internal identifier that can identify a request. With it, we can look up a particular request and use this to investigate potential issues.

The `Trace-Id` is returned as a header in the response. It is therefore recommended to log the `Trace-Id` for failed requests.

The `Trace-Id` can also be found in the webhook event metadata.
